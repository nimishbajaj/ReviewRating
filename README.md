# ReviewRating
A machine learning utility that reads through the text and gives star rating to a review.
This is a simple implementation, it cannot understand sarcasm.

To run just download TweetRating.R and tweets.csv and put them in the same directory before running.
If you want to increase the accuracy you can change the data set to a bigger one, I have used a small database only for experimentation.
